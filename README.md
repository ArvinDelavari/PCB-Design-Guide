## Electronics Hardware design guide
- Common and useful schematics for filters, decoupling filters, noise reduction, power factor correction and â€¦
- Following circuit schematic diagrams are used for digital circuits including STM 32 and NXP ARM microcontrollers (Cortex M0 , M0+, M3) and AVR, microcontrollers(ATMEGA 16, ATMEGA 32, ATMEGA 328, ATMEGA 2560).
- Filters and techniques mentioned in this file are not commonly used in FPGA, MPU, other professional high frequency boards with complicated processing units, switching high voltage/power circuit boards.
